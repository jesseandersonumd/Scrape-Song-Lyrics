Just because you want my loving
It's not enough to just turn me on
But when you touch me, oh!
I really feel it boy
That I don't wanna be left alone
I see you're using me
I won't be a fool
So see what you do to me
If you tell me true
I will, I will give my love to you
Baby baby just give me the real deal
Don't say maybe, my heart beats for you
Baby baby, you know how you make me feel
Never maybe, I'll give my love to you
Every time I see your picture
I call you up and you're not at home
Now don't you want me?
Or are you playing, boy?
You got me hanging out on my own
You see you're hurting me
I won't play your games
I got what you really need
If you have a clue
I will, I will give my love to you
Baby baby just give me the real deal
Don't say maybe, my heart beats for you
Baby baby, you know how you make me feel
Never maybe, I'll give my love to you
Oo oo
Are you ready for love
To you oo
S'alright s'alright
Gonna be your baby
Gonna be your baby, boy
Gonna be your baby
Gonna be your baby, boy
I see you're using me
I won't be a fool
So see what you do to me
If you tell me true
I will, I will give my love to you
Baby baby just give me the real deal
Don't say maybe, my heart beats for you
Baby baby, you know how you make me feel
Never maybe, I'll give my love to you

I've been ready for love
Ever since I met you
And now I've had your love
I'm very glad I let you
'Cause I been looking for a lover
Who can make me feel
The way you do, and now I found you
It's the real deal
I been playing the field
But I was playing for keeps
And everywhere I seem to look
I found a bunch of sheep
Now a lamb in wolf's clothing
Is the last thing I need
But honey boys like you
Are a dying breed
Hah!
Are you a man or a mouse?
Baby baby just give me the real deal
Don't say maybe, my heart beats for you
Baby baby, you know how you make me feel
Never maybe, I'll give my love to you
