Girl I can't believe the love your giving me
Took me by suprise for your love has no disguise
You turn my head around 
You blow my mind with the love 
That makes me feel so good 
My world is upside down I feel strong

You really got me going crazy 
About your loving girl it's crazy 
Please stay my lady 
Without your love I just go crazy 
Thinking back in time 
When loneliness is mine
My life was bare without a love to share 

But now you turn mylife around 
You build me up and I know I'm really winning
In you the love I've found my head is spinning girl
It's just crazy how much I love you girl 
It's crazy please stay my lady
Without your love I just go crazy

So let me warm and embrace 
In our love feel your rating
For as the sun shine surely rise 
Never a tear she'll change your mind

'Cuz crazy about your loving girl it's crazy
Please stay my lady 
Without your love I just go crazy
It's crazy how much I love you girl 
It's crazy

Please stay my lady 
Without your love I just go crazy

Crazy how much I love you girl 
It's crazy please stay my lady
Without your love I just go crazy 
I'm just crazy
