Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Shall I stay - Would it be a sin,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

As the river flows
gently to the sea
Darling so we go
some things were meant to be

Take my hand - Take my whole life too,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

I can't help falling in love with you.
I can't help falling in love with you.
I can't help falling in love with you.
