I guess it was yourself you were involved with,
I would've sworn it was me.
I might've found out sooner
If you'd only let me close enough to see.

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend. That ain't no way to treat a lady,
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.

I was only bein' a picture,
With all the colors, I know,
While you were busy lookin' into
Wide blue mirrors and lovin' the show.

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend. That ain't no way to treat a lady,
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.
There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane,
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain;
And see the times you never felt me lovin' you or needin' you,
So leavin' you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain.

I was lookin' out for my happiness
While you were lookin' within
And before you knew your own reflection
Always starts to tire you, it's happened again.

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend. That ain't no way to treat a lady,
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.
